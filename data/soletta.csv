One of the ways of killing that\npacket context is returning false on the query callback. There were use\ncases, though, where those functions were triggered again, but the\nintention was to abandon older calls' contexts, what was not being done.\nThat could clutter sol-coap's layer with lots of pending contexts that\nwould only be freed after a long timeout. Thus, if those triggers would\nhappen too often, the memory usage would ramp up very quickly, what is\nunnacceptable.\n\nWe now introduced struct sol_oic_pending, which is a handle to those\ntransactions, so that the user may cancel them. The CoAP layer was\nadapted to make matches by pending contexts (using a weak pointer ref).\n\nThe name of a function there was changed to read better:\nsol_oic_client_find_resource() -> sol_oic_client_find_resources().\n\nThe JS bindings to OIC were temporarily disabled until people owning it\nare able to cope with these API changes.\n\nFinally, once there was an effort for pointer-returning functions of\nsol-oic-client.h to properly set errno on error scenarios, all the\nfunction chain spawning from them was adapted to cope with that.
