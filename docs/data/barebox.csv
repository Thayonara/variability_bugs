So we only have to\nunregister the children which are not cleaned up by the drivers,\nnamely fs devices.\nAlso, unregister all partitions on a disappearing device.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9987346529960632,USB,drivers/base/driver.c,0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

Additionally v7_mmu_cache_flush is called\nfrom v7_mmu_cache_off *after* disabling the MMU. With this\nthe following can happen:\n\n- v7_mmu_cache_off disables the MMU. From now on no new values\n  go to the data cache.\n- v7_mmu_cache_off calls v7_mmu_cache_flush which in turn puts\n  registers on the stack. Due to the MMU being disabled they\n  do not go into the data cache.\n- In v7_mmu_cache_flush the memory the stack is pointing to is\n  overwritten with the values currently being in the cache.\n- v7_mmu_cache_flush restores the registers from the stack with\n  values from the cache and not the memory where the values have\n  previously been written to.\n\nFix this by storing the registers on the stack *before* we disable\nthe MMU and restore them after we have called v7_mmu_cache_flush.\nThis way v7_mmu_cache_flush still restores corrupt register values\nfor the case when the MMU has been disabled, but we will restore\ncorrect values afterwards.\n\nThis has been first observed when switching to gcc-4.7.2 when compiling\nin Thumb2 mode, but could explain earlier problems also. The result\nhere was that the register holding the kernel address in start_linux()\nwas corrupted so that the kernel could not be started.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9994215965270996,"ARM, MMU",arch/arm/cpu/cache-armv7.S,0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

CALGN(1)+0) == 0:\n\nsave r8:\n-       stmfd   sp!, {r4-r7, lr}\n+       stmfd   sp!, {r4-r8, lr}\n\nand restore r8 on both exit paths:\n        bgt     3b\n-       ldmeqfd sp!, {r4-r7, pc}\n+       ldmeqfd sp!, {r4-r8, pc}\n(...)\n        tst     r2, #16\n        stmneia ip!, {r4-r7}\n-       ldmfd   sp!, {r4-r7, lr}\n+       ldmfd   sp!, {r4-r8, lr}\n\nStep 4\n======\nRewrite register list ""r4-r7, r8"" as ""r4-r8"".\n\nSigned-off-by: Ivan Djelic <ivan.djelic@parrot.com>\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9994211196899414,ARM,arch/arm/lib/memset.S,0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

Configure it that way during\nstartup.\n\nThe 0b11 value previously in this field causes some nasty behaviour in\nthe Linux kernel:\n\n- The i.MX35 has two bits per clock gate which are decoded as follows:\n  0b00 -> clock off\n  0b01 -> clock is on in run mode, off in wait/doze\n  0b10 -> clock is on in run/wait mode, off in doze\n  0b11 -> clock is always on\n\nThe MAX clock is needed by the SoC, yet unused in the Kernel, so the\ncommon clock framework will disable it during late init time. It will\nonly disable clocks though which it detects as being on. This detection\nis made depending on the lower bit of the gate. So with the value of\n0b11 the clock framework will detect the clock as turned on, yet unused,\nhence it will turn it off and the system locks up.\nWith the value of 0b10 instead, the clock framework will detect the\nclock as being disabled and will not try to turn it off, so the\nsystem works.\n\nThe real bug is in the Linux clock framework. However, the value 0f 0b10\nseems to be a sane default value, so restore it. This lets Linux work\nagain and gives time to fix the bug in Linux.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.7660563588142395,ARM,arch/arm/mach-imx/clk-imx35.c,0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

This is called from both the PBL uncompression\ncode and also from the final image. To make it work properly it is\ncrucial that it's called with the same arguments both times. Currently\nit is called with the wrong image size from the PBL uncompression code.\nThe size passed to arm_mem_barebox_image() has to be the size of the\nwhole uncompressed image including the BSS segment size. The PBL code\ncalls it with the compressed image size instead and without the BSS\nsegment. This patch fixes this by reading the uncompressed image size\nfrom the compressed binary (the uncompressed size is appended to the\nend of the compressed binary by our compression wrappers). The size\nof the BSS segment is unknown though by the PBL uncompression code,\nso we introduce a maximum BSS size which is used instead.\n\nThe code before this patch worked by accident because the base address\nof the final image was aligned down to a 1MiB boundary. The alignment\nwas sufficient already to make enough space.

This register is located\nat a common offset for all mx6 SoC - except for i.MX6SL where a different\noffset is used. This creates a dilemma while distinguishing the mx6sl from\nnon-mx6sl SOC since the SoC type identification register location is type\nspecific itself.\n\nAccess to undocumented and probably invalid or unpredictable registers should\nbe avoided as possible. For the mx6sl detection an access to the general\nUSB_ANALOG_DIGPROG @0x260 cannot be avoided when running on mx6sl. This\nregister contained the value 0x00014009 for different mx6sl Rev. 1.2 based\ne-book readers using MCIMX6L7DVN10AB and MCIMX6L8DVN10AB SoC. This\nimplementation assumes the value of MAJOR_UPPER (here 0x01) to be smaller\nthan the smallest non-6sl MAJOR_UPPER (0x61 for mx6s).\n\nSigned-off-by: Alexander Kurz <akurz@blala.de>\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>,1,0.9663289785385132,"ARM, MCI, USB","arch/arm/mach-imx/Kconfig, arch/arm/mach-imx/imx6.c, arch/arm/mach-imx/include/mach/imx6.h",1,build system,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

Otherwise glitches on the clock line may occur\nwhich result in errors like:\n\nMXS NAND: Error sending command\nMXS NAND: DMA read error\n\nThere were previous attempts to fix this. One is in:\n\n54961378f0 imx6: clk: Gate off ENFC clock before setting clock rate\n\nThis patch added a clk_disable() right before the rate change. Since\na clk_disable() on a disabled clk is a no-op, the patch added a\nclk_enable() to the i.MX6 clk driver in the hope that the clk is\nenabled in the nand driver probe and the clk_disable() really takes\nplace.\n\nThis patch doesn't work. First of all it enabled the enfc_podf clk\nwhich was not the one that was actually disabled in the nand driver,\nresulting in the nand drivers call to clk_disable() still being a\nno-op. Then this patch also only works only on the classic i.MX6 which\nwas the only one supported at that time, but not on the i.MX6UL, i.MX6SX\nand i.MX6SL which have a separate clk driver.\n\nInstead of adding more quirks to the other i.MX6 clk drivers, fix this\nin the GPMI driver. We no longer call clk_disable() on a disabled clk,\nbut instead do a clk_enable() first which makes sure the hardware state\nis synchronized to the usage count and the following clk_disable()\nis really effective. At the same time we can (and actually must) remove\nthe quirk in the i.MX6 clk driver.\n\nAlso add clk_disable()/clk_enable() around another rate change in the\nGPMI driver.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9997264742851256,NAND,"drivers/clk/imx/clk-imx6.c, drivers/mtd/nand/nand_mxs.c",0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

Hence, the DWC driver must not make\n    assumptions that one register space can be accessed at a fixed offset from\n    any other register space. To avoid such assumptions, introduce an\n    explicit/separate register pointer for the ATU register space. In\n    particular, the current assumption is not valid for NVIDIA's T194 SoC.\n\n    The ATU register space is only used on systems that require unrolled ATU\n    access. This property is detected at run-time for host controllers, and\n    when this is detected, this patch provides a default value for atu_base\n    that matches the previous assumption re: register layout. An alternative\n    would be to update all drivers for HW that requires unrolled access to\n    explicitly set atu_base. However, it's hard to tell which drivers would\n    require atu_base to be set. The unrolled property is not detected for\n    endpoint systems, and so any endpoint driver that requires unrolled access\n    must explicitly set the iatu_unroll_enabled flag (none do at present), and\n    so a check is added to require the driver to also set atu_base while at\n    it.\n\n    Signed-off-by: Stephen Warren <swarren@nvidia.com>\n    Signed-off-by: Lorenzo Pieralisi <lorenzo.pieralisi@arm.com>\n    Acked-by: Gustavo Pimentel <gustavo.pimentel@synopsys.com>\n    Acked-by: Vidya Sagar <vidyas@nvidia.com>\n\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9994534850120544,PCI,"drivers/pci/pcie-designware-host.c, drivers/pci/pcie-designware.c, drivers/pci/pcie-designware.h",0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

For this reason we cleared the NAND_BBT_CREATE flag and\nhave the imx_nand_bbm command to create a BBT if none is found in the\nflash. We have also cleared the NAND_BBT_WRITE flag which causes\nproblems.  Normally a BBT occupies two blocks in NAND, but to have some\nspace for the BBT when one of these becomes bad we normally reserve 4\nblocks for the BBT. In case we want to write the BBT to flash we have to\nreserve them from being written to by general NAND operations. In case\nwe don't ever write to the BBT, as indicated by a cleared NAND_BBT_WRITE\nflag, the reserved blocks can be used by the general NAND operations.\nThis way it happens that barebox uses the reserved blocks for data\nstorage, but Linux (which has NAND_BBT_WRITE set) can't read any data\nfrom it.  This results in corrupted UBI images.\n\nIt's not necessary to clear the NAND_BBT_WRITE flag, all we really have\nto do is to prevent the BBT layer from creating a new BBT. For this it's\nenough to clear the NAND_BBT_CREATE flag.\n\nFixes: 545453ddae (""mtd: nand: Add command to generate a flash BBT"")\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9996224641799928,NAND,"drivers/mtd/nand/nand_imx.c, drivers/mtd/nand/nand_imx_bbm.c",0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

This\nintroduces resource problems when some device triggers a poller by calling\na delay function and then the poller code calls into the same device again.\n\nAs an example consider a I2C GPIO expander which drives a LED which shall\nbe used as a heartbeat LED:\n\npoller -> LED on/off -> GPIO high/low -> I2C transfer\n\nThe I2C controller has a timeout loop using is_timeout() and thus can trigger\na poller run. With this the following can happen during an unrelated I2C\ntransfer:\n\nI2C transfer -> is_timeout() -> poller -> LED on/off -> GPIO high/low -> I2C transfer\n\nWe end up with issuing an I2C transfer during another I2C transfer and\nthings go downhill.\n\nDue to the lack of interrupts we can't do real locking in barebox. We use\na mechanism called slices instead. A slice describes a resource to which\nother slices can be attached. Whenever a slice is needed it must be acquired.\nAcquiring a slice never fails, it just increases the acquired counter of\nthe slice and its dependent slices. when a slice shall be used inside a\npoller it must first be tested if the slice is already in use. If it is,\nwe can't do the operation on the slice now and must return and hope that\nwe have more luck in the next poller call.\n\nslices can be attached other slices as dependencies. In the example above\nLED driver would add a dependency to the GPIO controller and the GPIO driver\nwould add a dependency to the I2C bus:\n\nGPIO driver probe:\n\nslice_add(&gpio->slice, i2c_device_slice(i2cdev));\n\nLED driver probe:\n\nslice_add(&led->slice, gpio_slice(gpio));\n\nThe GPIO code would call slice_acquire(&gpio->slice) before doing any\noperation on the GPIO chip providing this GPIO, likewise the I2C core\nwould call slice_acquire(&i2cbus->slice) before doing an operation on\nthis I2C bus.\n\nThe heartbeat poller code would call slice_acquired(led_slice(led)) and\nonly continue when the slice is not acquired.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9996224641799928,"I2C, LED","commands/Kconfig, common/Makefile, common/slice.c, include/slice.h",1,build system,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

The only exception so far was barebox proper:\nWhen only the PBL fits in on-chip SRAM, barebox proper is chainloaded\nfrom the boot medium. To avoid TOCTOU attack, it's read fully into DRAM\nafter setup and then a SHA256 is calculated and compared against the\nhash embedded in barebox PBL, which in a secure boot system would be\ntrusted by virtue of the PBL as a whole being verified beforehand by\nthe BootROM.\n\nReuse this mechanism to support arbitrary firmware, which is now termed\nexternal firmware. Such firmware is placed beyond the piggydata (barebox\nproper) and only offset and hash are included in the prebootloader\nimage. The new get_builtin_firmware_ext() is used to retrieve this\nexternal firmware after integrity verification with SHA256.\n\nThis enables referencing firmware blobs from PBL that would bloat the\nsize of the PBL beyond what can fit into on-chip SRAM, e.g. very big\nOP-TEE binaries. As users of get_builtin_firmware() didn't have to worry\nabout TOCTOU so far, we panic when a firmware verification fails to\nensure that we never load an OP-TEE that has been modified in-transit\nWe can't include the OP-TEE binary in barebox proper, because we need\nto install it in EL3, but barebox proper on the i.MX8M runs as BL33\nin a lower exception level.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ahmad Fatoum <a.fatoum@pengutronix.de>\nLink: https://lore.barebox.org/20220818050447.2072932-3-a.fatoum@pengutronix.de\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9994896650314332,"SRAM, TEE","arch/arm/lib/pbl.lds.S, firmware/Makefile, include/firmware.h",1,build system,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

Commented line:\n 1. side A is in the CLOSED state and side B is in the LISTEN state;\n 2. side A open a new connection and send a SYN packet and is received by\n    side B which enters the SYN_RECEIVED state and send back a SYN-ACK;\n 3. side A receive the SYN-ACK packet from B;\n 4. side A respond with an ACK packet and move to the ESTABLISHED state.\n    Meanwhile;\n 5. side B hasn't received yet the ACK from side A and decide to\n    retransmit the SYN-ACK packet;\n 6. side B finally receive the ACK from side A and move to the\n    ESTABLISHED state;\n 7. side A finally receive the duplicated SYN-ACK packet from side B,\n    execute behavior C2: the received packet doesn't have the expected\n    SN and has the SYN flag set, thus respond by sending a legal reset.\n  8. side B receive the reset and close the connection.\n\nOne solution could be to tweak the initial RTO value of side B in order\nto prevent sending a duplicated SYN-ACK packet, however the initial RTT\nvalue is likely inaccurate during the handshake. This solution seems a\nbit brittle.\n\nThe second solution would be to consider that a host has crashed only if\nthe packet received has the SYN flag set but not the ACK flag. The\nrational is that the first step during handshake is to send a packet\nonly containing the SYN flag, however a packet containing both ACK and\nSYN flags must have come after the initial handshake exchange and can\nbe considered as a duplicated and be dropped.\n\nI proposed the following errata to RFC916 [1]:\n[Page 29]\n- If SYN was set we assume that the other end crashed and has\n- attempted to open a new connection. We respond by sending a\n- legal reset:\n+ If the SYN flag was set but the ACK was not set then we assume\n+ that the other end crashed and has attempted to open a new connection.\n+ We respond by sending a legal reset:\n\n[Page 30]\n- If neither RST, FIN, nor SYN flags were set it is assumed that\n- this packet is a duplicate of one already received. Send an\n- ACK back:\n+ If neither RST nor FIN flags were set, or if SYN and ACK flags\n+ were set, it is assumed that this packet is a duplicate of one\n+ already received.

To determine end of SDRAM, barebox may need a stack setup, so\nat that early time, either stack pointer set up by BootROM is reused\nor we set up a temporary stack on some on-chip SRAM .\n\nOn STM32MP1, TF-A runs after BootROM, so barebox runs in normal world\nwithout prepared stack and TF-A is located on on-chip SRAM.\n\nSo what we did so far was have a small stack of 64 bytes starting behind\nend of barebox image to cover the first function call to determine\nactual memory size. This may have been chosen that small with the thought\nthat an overflow would give an error message anyway, because of failed\ndecompression. An overflow of exactly 4 bytes overwrites just the barebox\nproper image size though located at the end of the barebox image, thereby\noverflowing the size and leading to out-of-bounds access during decompression\nin 1 of 4 cases depending on barebox size, because we align barebox\nproper size to 16 bytes...\n\nLet's just use a fully sized stack even in the early state. That's\nusually 32K and we expect a barebox loaded into DRAM to always have\nthat much bytes following it.

However, this is not always true. For example, MIPS\narchitecture requires an explicit conversion from the physical address\nspace to some virtual address space segment to get a valid CPU-side\npointer. Another issue is that DMA ranges that may be specified in a\ndevice tree will not work this way. To get from a virtual address to a\ndma handle and vice versa we need to add/subtract some offset, which is\ncalculated from ""dma-ranges"" property. Only dma_map_single() was doing\nthis, but dma_sync_single_for_*() also should.\n\nImprove the interface by adding 'struct device' as the first argument to\nthe dma_sync_single_for_*(). This allows to do cpu_to_dma/dma_to_cpu()\nconversions in common code and call into arch-specific code with proper\ncpu-side addresses. To make things more clear, make the virtual address\nargument of those arch-side functions be properly represented with a\nvoid* type.\n\nApply the required changes in device drivers that use the affected\nfunctions, making them pass the appropriate device pointer.\n\nSigned-off-by: Denis Orlov <denorl2009@gmail.com>\nLink: https://lore.barebox.org/20230604215002.20240-2-denorl2009@gmail.com\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9778711199760436,MIPS,"arch/arm/cpu/dma_32.c, arch/arm/cpu/dma_64.c, arch/arm/cpu/mmu-common.c, arch/arm/include/asm/dma.h, arch/arm/mach-bcm283x/mbox.c, arch/kvx/lib/dma-default.c, arch/mips/lib/dma-default.c, arch/riscv/cpu/dma.c, arch/sandbox/include/asm/dma.h, arch/x86/include/asm/dma.h, drivers/crypto/caam/caam-blobgen.c, drivers/crypto/caam/caamrng.c, drivers/crypto/caam/rng_self_test.c, drivers/dma/Makefile, drivers/dma/map.c, drivers/mci/dove-sdhci.c, drivers/mci/stm32_sdmmc2.c, drivers/mci/tegra-sdmmc.c, drivers/net/ag71xx.c, drivers/net/arc_emac.c, drivers/net/at91_ether.c, drivers/net/bcmgenet.c, drivers/net/cpsw.c, drivers/net/davinci_emac.c, drivers/net/designware.c, drivers/net/designware_eqos.c, drivers/net/e1000/main.c, drivers/net/fec_imx.c, drivers/net/fsl-fman.c, drivers/net/macb.c, drivers/net/mvneta.c, drivers/net/orion-gbe.c, drivers/net/r8169_main.c, drivers/usb/gadget/udc/fsl_udc.c, drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c, include/dma.h",1,build system,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

The SoC just hands a\nfile to the PMU and lets it load this file to the FPGA.\n\nThe bitstream that is sent to the FPGA consists of two headers, the\noptional struct bs_header and a binary-header. See comment in driver:\n\n (...)\n * Bitstream can be provided with an optinal header (`struct bs_header`).\n * The true bitstream starts with the binary-header composed of 21 words:\n (...)\n\nThe PMUFW v1.0 had a feature for taking the bitstream only, skipping\nthe header, or including the binary-header and only skipping the\noptional header. This is controlled via the BIT_ONLY_BIN flag. When\nthe flag is set, the complete header should be skipped.\n\nThe current implementation sets the flag *and* sends the binary-header\nto the PMU:\n\n	header_length = get_header_length(mgr->buf, mgr->size);\n	(...)\n	body = (u32 *)&mgr->buf[header_length];\n\nget_header_length searches for the first DUMMY_WORD, i.e. the beginning\nof the binary header. Then we set body to this offset, skipping the\noptional header.\n\nThe flag is always set to ZYNQMP_FPGA_BIT_ONLY_BIN, which is then obviously\nincorrect. It seems like the PMUFW v1.0 was capable of still handling this\nalthough the flag was set.\n\nThe newer PMUFW v1.1 doesn't support this and expects the flag to be\nunset and getting handed binary-header+bitstream. This is the same as\nthe linux kernel handles bitstream loading on the ZynqMP. There the flag\nis also always unset.\n\nAs this wasn't correct in the first place (although it most likely still\nworked depending on PMUFW and its configuration), we won't break anything\nwhen we just set the flag to zero as the PMUFW v1.1 expects it.\n\nTLDR: set fpga_load flags to zero to fix firmwareloading with newer\nPMUFW versions.\n\nSigned-off-by: Steffen Trumtrar <s.trumtrar@pengutronix.de>\nReviewed-by: Michael Tretter <m.tretter@pengutronix.de>\nLink: https://lore.barebox.org/20230623114348.26213-1-s.trumtrar@pengutronix.de\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.999740183353424,"DUMMY, FPGA",drivers/firmware/zynqmp-fpga.c,0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

That means all reads\nand writes to the internal PHYs are dropped before anything goes out on\nthe bus.\n\nNotwithstanding that barebox issue, there is an ongoing discussion [1]\non the Linux mailing list as to the virtues (or lack thereof) of\nrealtek-mdio opting into this core functionality to begin with. The fact\nis that, for SMI-connected switches, realtek-smi absolutely expects an\nMDIO bus node. And the device tree bindings strongly (albeit not\nstrictly) assert that this node for both MDIO and SMI connected\nswitches. In the specific case of barebox, the driver likely has even\nfewer users, and realtek-mdio is currently broken, so there is nothing\nto break by strictly enforcing the presence of an MDIO node.\n\nThe same discussion [1] centers around an effort to actually unify\nlarge, common parts of the SMI and MDIO drivers, and ditching the\nasymmetric MDIO bus registration would make this effort even easier.\n\nTo that end, add a little bit more code in order to bury this particular\nissue once and for all in barebox. Further cleanup can be done to reduce\nthe overall quantity of code, probably following whatever ends up in\nLinux.\n\nA slice dependency is also added to the parent MDIO bus to prevent the\nPHY status polling from interleaving MDIO accesses during switch\nmanagement.\n\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231221174746.hylsmr3f7g5byrsi@skbuf/ [1]\nFixes: f9f31a9a21e4 (""net: dsa: add Realtek (rtl8365mb/rtl8366rb) switch support"")\nSigned-off-by: Alvin Šipraga <alsi@bang-olufsen.dk>\nLink: https://lore.barebox.org/20231222-realtek-mdio-fix-v1-2-6bbf80d6a756@bang-olufsen.dk\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9997382760047911,DSA,"drivers/net/realtek-dsa/realtek-mdio.c, drivers/net/realtek-dsa/rtl8365mb.c, drivers/net/realtek-dsa/rtl8366rb.c",0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

In so doing, it uses the device_node::dev pointer to\ncheck whether a given node has a device; if not, a device is created on\ndemand. The behaviour is recursive, so parent nodes without an\nassociated device will also have devices created on their behalf. The\nrecursion stops when a parent with a device is found.\n\nWeird behaviour can ensure if, when devices with a device_node are\nregistered, the device_node::dev field is not populated. This patch\naddresses a niche, benign, but also noisy error observed as a result of\nthis behaviour.\n\nOne mostly harmless consequence is that spurious devices can get created\nwhen a suitable one already exists.

But these\nso-called real devices are all created by mdio_bus, which only links one\nway, i.e. sets device::of_node, but not device_node::dev.\n\nThis issue probably goes unnoticed on most boards because, while the\ncall to of_device_ensure_probed() returns -ENODEV on the bottom listed\nnode, the code in phy.c doesn't check the return code, and the real\ndevices have already been probed, so no harm is done.\n\nI observed much more surprising behaviour on my board because the switch\nI am using, an RTL8365MB, has multiple possible management interfaces,\nfor which barebox has two drivers: realtek-smi and realtek-mdio (for\nSMI- and MDIO-connected switches, respectively). The compatible strings\nare the same, ""realtek,rtl8365mb"", but the bus types are different: the\nformer is a platform driver, the latter a phy (read: mdio) driver. In my\nbootloader I have both drivers built in, because some of my boards use\nSMI while others use MDIO.\n\nWhen I would run the command 'boot bnet', bringing up my network\ninterface, DSA would call phy_device_connect() to connect my edev with\nits corresponding phy, and a deep-probe would kick off because the phy's\nparent's device_node::dev field was not populated. And during the\ncreation of the spurious device for my (already probed) Ethernet switch,\nthe platform code would find a compatible string match with realtek-smi\nand try to probe the device with that driver:\n\n  Booting entry 'bnet'\n  ERROR: gpiolib: _gpio_request: gpio-233 (30be0000.ethernet@30be0000:mdio:ethernet-switch@1d.of-reset) status -16\n  ERROR: realtek-smi 30be0000.ethernet@30be0000:mdio:ethernet-switch@1d.of: error Device or resource busy: failed to get RESET GPIO\n  ERROR: realtek-smi 30be0000.ethernet@30be0000:mdio:ethernet-switch@1d.of: probe failed: Device or resource busy\n\nAs stated above, my switch is connected over MDIO, not SMI, so I really\nshould not be seeing any ""realtek-smi"" in my log. Nevertheless, because\nphy.c doesn't check for errors, the errors are benign and my network\nboot runs just fine.\n\nDumping the stack around the above error print in the realtek-smi driver\nreveals exactly why things are going wrong:\n\n  ERROR: gpiolib: _gpio_request: gpio-233 (30be0000.ethernet@30be0000:mdio:ethernet-switch@1d.of-reset) status -16\n  Call trace:\n  [<7dd8f400>] (unwind_backtrace+0x0/0x90)\n  [<7dd8f4a0>] (dump_stack+0x10/0x18)\n  [<7dd2d4d4>] (realtek_smi_probe+0x16c/0x2f4)\n  [<7dd1da28>] (platform_probe+0x48/0x4c)\n  [<7dd1cf24>] (device_probe+0x80/0x13c)\n  [<7dd1d028>] (match+0x48/0x58)\n  [<7dd1d3c8>] (register_device+0x178/0x184)\n  [<7dd1da80>] (platform_device_register+0x18/0x20)\n  [<7dd5501c>] (of_platform_device_create+0x2b8/0x2e0)\n  [<7dd55170>] (of_device_create_on_demand+0x84/0xc0)\n  [<7dd5513c>] (of_device_create_on_demand+0x50/0xc0)\n  [<7dd552e0>] (of_device_ensure_probed+0x40/0x6c)\n  [<7dd21398>] (phy_device_connect+0x174/0x230)\n  [<7dd1fd74>] (dsa_port_start+0x60/0x1f0)\n  [<7dd7a0e4>] (eth_open+0x24/0x44)\n  [<7dd7d7e4>] (ifup_edev+0x9c/0x2ec)\n  [<7dd7dbe4>] (ifup_all+0x110/0x204)\n  [<7dd7dd2c>] (do_ifup+0x54/0xd4)\n  [<7dd09e78>] (execute_command+0x44/0x8c)\n  ...\n\nThe whole mess is rectified if the proper linking is done by mdio_bus,\nsince it is responsible for creating all of the devices to begin with.\nSo, make sure that the device_node::dev field is populated in all cases\nthere.\n\nNote that while I also make this change in of_mdiobus_register_phy(), I\ndid not actually observe any unwanted behaviour by not doing so - the\nproblem above is specifically because it's not done in\nof_mdiobus_register() or of_mdiobus_register_device().

The problem with that is that data from\nthe previous installation may persist and confuse later software, e.g.\nan existing barebox state partition not contained in the image may\nsurvive, when the expectation is that a new state is created.\n\neMMCs can support three different commands for erasing data:\n\n  - Erase: This has the widest support, but works on only on the level\n    of erase groups that may span multiple write blocks.\n    The region reads as either '0' or '1' afterwards.\n\n  - Trim: New in eMMC v4.4. This erases write blocks.\n    The region reads as either '0' or '1' afterwards.\n\n  - Discard: New in eMMC v4.5. This discards write blocks. It's up to the\n    card what action if any is taken.\n    All or part of the data may remain accessible.\n\nAll of these don't enforce a actual physical NAND erase operation.\nIn case erasure does happen, it may happen later at a convenient time.\n\nAll of them, except for discard guarantee that a fixed pattern (either\nall zeroes or all ones) will be read back after the erase operation\nconcludes. Therefore let's use them in barebox to implement the erase\ncommand.\n\nThe behavior of the erase command will be similar to the Linux\nblkdiscard -z command when the erase byte value is all-zeroes. In Linux\nblkdiscard -z is emulated with zero writes if the erased byte is 0xFF,\nbut for barebox, the erase operation won't care whether it writes 0x00\nor 0xFF.\n\nNote that this is considerably slower than need be, because we don't\nerase multiple erase groups at once. Doing so could run into the\nsend_cmd timeout of the host hardware or its drivers.

In future, these types may\n    be replaces by more specific typedefs.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ahmad Fatoum <a.fatoum@barebox.org>\nLink: https://lore.barebox.org/20250527212300.575031-12-a.fatoum@barebox.org\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9994134902954102,EFI,"commands/efi_handle_dump.c, drivers/efi/efi-device.c, drivers/efi/efi-handle.c, drivers/serial/serial_efi.c, drivers/video/efi_gop.c, efi/payload/init.c, efi/payload/iomem.c, fs/efi.c, fs/efivarfs.c, include/efi.h, include/efi/efi-device.h, include/efi/efi-payload.h",0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox

Trying to naively\nenable it on an i.MX6Q boards was observed to cause spurious hangs on\nreturn from OP-TEE to barebox.\n\nQuoting Lucas[1]:\n\n  The real issue with the Cortex A9 caches is that the tags aren't\n  cleared on power-up, so some sets/ways may end up in ""valid"" state if\n  not explicitly invalidated. Thus any write to memory may get stuck in\n  the cache, even if caching is disabled, as this knob only turns off\n  allocation in the cache, but doesn't prevent updates of such bogus\n  valid lines. If you then proceed to invalidate the cache, you may\n  discard data that has not yet reached DRAM.\n\nThis issue did likely not affect the original i.MX6UL, Quoting Lucas\nagain[2]:\n\n  > How do we know we only need this for Cortex-A9 though?\n  > Couldn't e.g. the Cortex-A8 also be affected?\n\n  We can't be 100% sure without specific knowledge about each SoC\n  integration. Both the Cortex A8 [1] and Cortex A15 [2] TRMs define a\n  reset sequence that mandates the straps to be set in such a way that\n  the processor will clear all L1 and L2 memory arrays on power-on reset.\n\n  The only odd one where the TRM doesn't even mention memory arrays in\n  the reset sequence is the Cortex A9 [3], which pretty much lines up\n  with the number of SoCs where we have seen issues due to uninitialized\n  cache content.\n\nTherefore, let's call arm_early_mmu_cache_invalidate() very early in the\nlow level init. We don't have a common Cortex-A9 init and the locations\ntouched here were determined by a grep for the Cortex-A9 errata that are\nalready being worked around by imx6_cpu_lowlevel_init().\n\n[1]: https://lore.barebox.org/barebox/569963942cf35755dfdf34b240c350986fda4727.camel@pengutronix.de/\n[2]: https://lore.barebox.org/barebox/d6a0be9631286122e56fdfd87b9911c310554baf.camel@pengutronix.de/\n\nSigned-off-by: Ahmad Fatoum <a.fatoum@pengutronix.de>\nLink: https://lore.barebox.org/20250610201320.2691564-2-a.fatoum@pengutronix.de\nSigned-off-by: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>",1,0.9995536208152772,"ARM, TEE","arch/arm/mach-imx/cpu_init.c, arch/arm/mach-socfpga/cpu_init.c, arch/arm/mach-tegra/tegra_maincomplex_init.c, arch/arm/mach-zynq/cpu_init.c",0,other,other,barebox.json,repos/barebox
